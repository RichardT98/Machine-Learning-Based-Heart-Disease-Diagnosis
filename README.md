# Machine-Learning-Based-Heart-Disease-Diagnosis
This is my bachelor's thesis project: Applying Machine Learning Classification Algorithms in Python to Detect Heart Diseases in Tabular Data.

My thesis title: "Applications of Machine Learning in the Diagnosis of Heart Diseases"

Both of the datasets containing real patient data and are publicly available free of charge. The used "Statlog.data" can be downloaded here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Heart%29 under the name "heart.dat"! The used "cleveland.data" can be downloaded here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease under the name "processed.cleveland.data"!

I used Python programming language. All of my coding steps are documented in the Jupyter Notebook files.

I applied cleaning on both datasets in my "Cleaning.ipynb" file. Furthermore, I also created a Combined dataset, where I merged the Cleveland and the Statlog dataset.

After cleaning, I performed 6 Machine Learning Classification Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbours) on all of the 3 datasets and evaluated their performance based on Accuracy and F1 Score. The code can be found in my "ML.ipynb" Notebook.
